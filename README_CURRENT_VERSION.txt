ALDEx2
======
ALDEx tool to examine compositional high-throughput sequence data.

A differential relative count abundance analysis for the comparison of 
two conditions. For example, single-organism and meta-rna-seq 
high-throughput sequencing assays, or of selected and unselected 
values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial 
model to infer abundance from counts, that has been optimized 
for three or more experimental replicates. Infers sampling 
variation and calculates the expected Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery 
rate given the biological and sampling variation using several parametric
and non-parametric tests. Can to glm and Kruskal-Wallace tests on 
one-way ANOVA style designs.
