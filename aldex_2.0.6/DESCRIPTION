Description: A differential count abundance analysis for the comparison of two conditions. For example, single-organism and meta-rna-seq high-throughput sequencing assays, or of selected and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts, that has been optimized for three or more experimental replicates. Infers sampling variation and calculates the expected local false discovery rate given the biological and sampling variation using either Wilcox rank test or Welches t-test. Reports both lfdr and q values calculated by fdrtool. Includes some garbage collection.
